## ABOUT ME
Thank you for visting my data analysis portfolio. My name is Justin Lyu, and I am currently in my final semester of my Bachelor of Science program at the University of Toronto, majoring in Economics and minoring in Statistics and Mathematics. 
This portfolio contains several projects I have worked on which, as a whole, aim to showcase a variety of different techniques and methods of data analysis. Please have a look at whichever projects interest you, and I would be happy to answer any questions about them through my contact information below.

Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).<br />
