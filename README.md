## ABOUT ME
Thank you for visting my data analysis portfolio! My name is Justin Lyu, and I am currently in my final semester of my Bachelor of Science program at the University of Toronto, majoring in Economics and minoring in Statistics and Mathematics. 

This portfolio contains several projects I have worked on which, as a whole, aim to showcase a variety of different techniques and methods of data analysis. Please have a look at whichever projects interest you, and I would be happy to answer any questions about them through my contact information below.

## PROJECT OVERVIEWS
Below is a description and brief overview for each data analytics project.

[1. Optimizing Bike-Share Pricing in Toronto](https://justinryuu.github.io/bike-share-pricing-analysis/)<br />
This project aims to provide an alternative pricing scheme for the Bike Share Toronto service in a way that would encourage ridership whilst maintaining or improving potential revenues for the service itself. This analysis employs a variety of basic data analysis techniques, such as the examination of summary measures, bootstrap sampling, and the calculation of 95% confidence intervals.
<br />
<br />
**Subject Areas**: Data Collection, Summary Analysis, Bootstrap Sampling, Confidence Interval Analysis <br />
<br />
<br />
[2. Impact of COVID-19 on the Labour Force](https://justinryuu.github.io/covid-labor-force-analysis/)<br />
I created this project during my time as a recently-unemployed student as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Being such an extraordinary time in all capacities, but especially economically, I wanted to conduct an analysis on the effects of the pandemic on students like myself, with the goal of quantifying the impact of the pandemic on key measures like unemployment, but also how employment might have transformed through changes in the labour force participation rate. <br />
<br />
**Subject Areas**:  Economics, Data Collection and Analysis, Summary Analysis, Bootstrap Confidence Intervals <br />
<br />
<br />
[3. Lifestyle Factors in Global Health](https://justinryuu.github.io/lifestyle-factors-and-global-health-research/)<br />
This project is a much more formal analysis on the impact of health-adjacent lifestyle factors in key measures of global health. This analysis utilizes a variety of methods in the selection of variables and justification of multiple linear regression.
<br />
<br />
**Subject Areas**: Multiple Linear Regression, Model Building and Diagnostics, Variable Selection, Residual Analysis, Goodness of Fit Testing <br />
<br />
<br />
[4. New York Workers’ Compensation Market Analysis](https://justinryuu.github.io/Insurance-Market-Research-Analysis/)<br />
This is a report I developed during my time as a Market Research Data Analyst for an insurance consulting company in New York. The company was seeking information about the workers' compensation and disability insurance market in New York state, and used this report to identify potential entry opportunities and novel insurance products for its clients.
<br />
<br />
**Subject Areas**: Insurance, Data Retrieval and Cleaning, Data Analysis, Regression Analysis, Data Visualization <br />
<br />
<br />
[5. 2025 Election Forecast using Non-representative Survey Data](https://justinryuu.github.io/2025-election-forecast/)<br />
This project was inspired by a very interesting article written in the [International Journal of Forecasting](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/forecasting-with-nonrepresentative-polls.pdf) that used survey data gathered from users on the Xbox gaming platform to accurately predict the outcome of the 2012 US presidential election. Using similar techniques to those implemented in the article, I was able to use non-representative demographic data from the Canadian census as well as a large-scale phone survey to construct a reasonable prediction for the 2025 Canadian Election outcome.
<br />
<br />
**Subject Areas**: Survey and Demographic Analysis, Forecasting, Non-Representative Data Analysis <br />
